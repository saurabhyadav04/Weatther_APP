### Difficulties faced during development
- I was not aware of React and its functionality, so it took 4-5 days in learning the concepts of React, authorization with Oauth2 and working with API. Making Login with CodeChef Credentials (using the CodeChef API OAuth) was one of the difficult part. 

### Technologies used:-
- React
- Javascript
- Codechef API
- Bootstrap v3
- Reactstrap
- Netlify(a cloud computing company)
